  ///
  ///     final min = await Stream.fromIterable([1, 2, 3]).min();

  ///     print(min); // prints 1

  /// ### Example with custom [Comparator]
  ///
  ///     final stream = Stream.fromIterable(['short', 'looooooong']);
  ///     final min = await stream.min((a, b) => a.length - b.length);
  ///
  ///     print(min); // prints 'short'
