/// A wrapper class that extends Stream. It combines all the Streams and
/// StreamTransformers contained in this library into a fluent api.
///
/// ### Example
///
///     new Observable(new Stream.fromIterable([1]))
///       .interval(new Duration(seconds: 1))
///       .flatMap((i) => new Observable.just(2))
///       .take(1)
///       .listen(print); // prints 2
///
/// ### Learning RxDart
///
/// This library contains documentation and examples for each method. In
/// addition, more complex examples can be found in the
/// [RxDart github repo](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxdart) demonstrating how
/// to use RxDart with web, command line, and Flutter applications.
///
/// #### Additional Resources
///
/// In addition to the RxDart documentation and examples, you can find many
/// more articles on Dart Streams that teach the fundamentals upon which
/// RxDart is built.
///
///   - [Asynchronous Programming: Streams](https://www.dartlang.org/tutorials/language/streams)
///   - [Single-Subscription vs. Broadcast Streams](https://www.dartlang.org/articles/libraries/broadcast-streams)
///   - [Creating Streams in Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/articles/libraries/creating-streams)
///   - [Testing Streams: Stream Matchers](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/test#stream-matchers)
///
/// ### Dart Streams vs Observables
///
/// In order to integrate fluently with the Dart ecosystem, the Observable class
/// extends the Dart `Stream` class. This provides several advantages:
///
///    - Observables work with any API that expects a Dart Stream as an input.
///    - Inherit the many methods and properties from the core Stream API.
///    - Ability to create Streams with language-level syntax.
///
/// Overall, we attempt to follow the Observable spec as closely as we can, but
/// prioritize fitting in with the Dart ecosystem when a trade-off must be made.
/// Therefore, there are some important differences to note between Dart's
/// `Stream` class and standard Rx `Observable`.
///
/// First, Cold Observables in Dart are single-subscription. In other words,
/// you can only listen to Observables once, unless it is a hot (aka broadcast)
/// Stream. If you attempt to listen to a cold stream twice, a StateError will
/// be thrown. If you need to listen to a stream multiple times, you can simply
/// create a factory function that returns a new instance of the stream.
///
/// Second, many methods contained within, such as `first` and `last` do not
/// return a `Single` nor an `Observable`, but rather must return a Dart Future.
/// Luckily, Dart Futures are easy to work with, and easily convert back to a
/// Stream using the `myFuture.asStream()` method if needed.
///
/// Third, Streams in Dart do not close by default when an error occurs. In Rx,
/// an Error causes the Observable to terminate unless it is intercepted by
/// an operator. Dart has mechanisms for creating streams that close when an
/// error occurs, but the majority of Streams do not exhibit this behavior.
///
/// Fourth, Dart streams are asynchronous by default, whereas Observables are
/// synchronous by default, unless you schedule work on a different Scheduler.
/// You can create synchronous Streams with Dart, but please be aware the the
/// default is simply different.
///
/// Finally, when using Dart Broadcast Streams (similar to Hot Observables),
/// please know that `onListen` will only be called the first time the
/// broadcast stream is listened to.
