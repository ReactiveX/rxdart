/// A utility class that provides static methods to create the various Streams
/// provided by RxDart.
///
/// ### Example
///
///      Rx.combineLatest([
///        Stream.value("a"),
///        Stream.fromIterable(["b", "c", "d"])
///      ], (list) => list.join())
///      .listen(print); // prints "ab", "ac", "ad"
///
/// ### Learning RxDart
///
/// This library contains documentation and examples for each method. In
/// addition, more complex examples can be found in the
/// [RxDart github repo](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxdart) demonstrating how
/// to use RxDart with web, command line, and Flutter applications.
///
/// #### Additional Resources
///
/// In addition to the RxDart documentation and examples, you can find many
/// more articles on Dart Streams that teach the fundamentals upon which
/// RxDart is built.
///
///   - [Asynchronous Programming: Streams](https://www.dartlang.org/tutorials/language/streams)
///   - [Single-Subscription vs. Broadcast Streams](https://www.dartlang.org/articles/libraries/broadcast-streams)
///   - [Creating Streams in Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/articles/libraries/creating-streams)
///   - [Testing Streams: Stream Matchers](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/test#stream-matchers)
///
/// ### Dart Streams vs Traditional Rx Observables
/// In ReactiveX, the Observable class is the heart of the ecosystem.
/// Observables represent data sources that emit "items" or "events" over time.
/// Dart already includes such a data source: Streams.
///
/// In order to integrate fluently with the Dart ecosystem, Rx Dart does not
/// provide a [Stream] class, but rather adds functionality to Dart Streams.
/// This provides several advantages:
///
///    - RxDart works with any API that expects a Dart Stream as an input.
///    - No need to implement or replace the many methods and properties from the core Stream API.
///    - Ability to create Streams with language-level syntax.
///
/// Overall, we attempt to follow the ReactiveX spec as closely as we can, but
/// prioritize fitting in with the Dart ecosystem when a trade-off must be made.
/// Therefore, there are some important differences to note between Dart's
/// [Stream] class and standard Rx `Observable`.
///
/// First, Cold Observables exist in Dart as normal Streams, but they are
/// single-subscription only. In other words, you can only listen a Stream
/// once, unless it is a hot (aka broadcast) Stream. If you attempt to listen to
/// a cold Stream twice, a StateError will be thrown. If you need to listen to a
/// stream multiple times, you can simply create a factory function that returns
/// a new instance of the stream.
///
/// Second, many methods contained within, such as `first` and `last` do not
/// return a `Single` nor an `Observable`, but rather must return a Dart Future.
/// Luckily, Dart's `Future` class is  conceptually similar to `Single`, and can
/// be easily converted back to a Stream using the `myFuture.asStream()` method
/// if needed.
///
/// Third, Streams in Dart do not close by default when an error occurs. In Rx,
/// an Error causes the Observable to terminate unless it is intercepted by
/// an operator. Dart has mechanisms for creating streams that close when an
/// error occurs, but the majority of Streams do not exhibit this behavior.
///
/// Fourth, Dart streams are asynchronous by default, whereas Observables are
/// synchronous by default, unless you schedule work on a different Scheduler.
/// You can create synchronous Streams with Dart, but please be aware the the
/// default is simply different.
///
/// Finally, when using Dart Broadcast Streams (similar to Hot Observables),
/// please know that `onListen` will only be called the first time the
/// broadcast stream is listened to.
