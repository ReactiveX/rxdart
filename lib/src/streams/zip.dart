/// It applies this function in strict sequence, so the first item emitted by
/// the new Stream will be the result of the function applied to the first
/// item emitted by Stream #1 and the first item emitted by Stream #2;
/// the second item emitted by the new ZipStream will be the result of

///
/// ### Basic Example
///
///     ZipStream(
///       [
///         Stream.fromIterable(['A']),
///         Stream.fromIterable(['B']),
///         Stream.fromIterable(['C', 'D']),
///       ],
///       (values) => values.join(),
///     ).listen(print); // prints 'ABC'
///
/// ### Example with a specific number of Streams
///
/// If you wish to zip a specific number of Streams together with proper types
/// information for the value of each Stream, use the [zip2] - [zip9] operators.
///
///     ZipStream.zip2(
///       Stream.fromIterable(['A']),
///       Stream.fromIterable(['B', 'C']),
///       (a, b) => a + b,
///     )
///     .listen(print); // prints 'AB'
