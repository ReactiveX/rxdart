/// This operator is best used when you have a group of streams
/// and only care about the final emitted value of each.
/// One common use case for this is if you wish to issue multiple
/// requests on page load (or some other event)
/// and only want to take action when a response has been received for all.
///
/// In this way it is similar to how you might use [Future.wait].
///
/// Be aware that if any of the inner streams supplied to forkJoin error
/// you will lose the value of any other streams that would or have already
/// completed if you do not catch the error correctly on the inner stream.
///
/// If you are only concerned with all inner streams completing
/// successfully you can catch the error on the outside.
/// It's also worth noting that if you have an stream
/// that emits more than one item, and you are concerned with the previous
/// emissions forkJoin is not the correct choice.
///
/// In these cases you may better off with an operator like combineLatest or zip.
///
/// If the provided streams is empty, the resulting sequence completes immediately
/// without emitting any items and without any calls to the combiner function.
///
/// ### Basic Example
///
/// This constructor takes in an `Iterable<Stream<T>>` and outputs a
/// `Stream<Iterable<T>>` whenever any of the values change from the source
/// stream. This is useful with a dynamic number of source streams!
///
///     ForkJoinStream.list<String>([
///       Stream.fromIterable(['a']),
///       Stream.fromIterable(['b']),
///       Stream.fromIterable(['C', 'D'])])
///     .listen(print); //prints ['a', 'b', 'D']
///
/// ### Example with combiner
///
/// If you wish to combine the list of values into a new object before you
///
///     CombineLatestStream(
///       [
///         Stream.fromIterable(['a']),
///         Stream.fromIterable(['b']),
///         Stream.fromIterable(['C', 'D'])
///       ],
///       (values) => values.last
///     )
///     .listen(print); //prints 'D'
///
/// ### Example with a specific number of Streams
///
/// If you wish to combine a specific number of Streams together with proper
/// types information for the value of each Stream, use the
/// [combine2] - [combine9] operators.
///
///     ForkJoinStream.combine2(
///       Stream.fromIterable([1]),
///       Stream.fromIterable([2, 3]),
///       (a, b) => a + b,
///     )
///     .listen(print); // prints 4
