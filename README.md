## About
RxDart is a reactive functional programming library for Google Dart, based on [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/).  
Google Dart comes with a very decent [Streams](https://api.dartlang.org/stable/1.21.1/dart-async/Stream-class.html) API out-of-the-box; rather than attempting to provide an alternative to this API, RxDart adds functionality on top of it.

## How To Use RxDart

### For Example: Reading the Konami Code 

```dart
void main() {
  const konamiKeyCodes = const <int>[
    KeyCode.UP,
    KeyCode.UP,
    KeyCode.DOWN,
    KeyCode.DOWN,
    KeyCode.LEFT,
    KeyCode.RIGHT,
    KeyCode.LEFT,
    KeyCode.RIGHT,
    KeyCode.B,
    KeyCode.A];

  final result = querySelector('#result');
  final keyUp = new Observable<KeyboardEvent>(document.onKeyUp);

  keyUp
    .map((event) => event.keyCode)
    .bufferWithCount(10, 1)
    .where((lastTenKeyCodes) => const IterableEquality<int>().equals(lastTenKeyCodes, konamiKeyCodes))
    .listen((_) => result.innerHtml = 'KONAMI!');
}
```

## API Overview

RxDart's Observables extend the Stream class.
This has two major implications:  
- All [methods defined on the Stream class](https://api.dartlang.org/stable/1.21.1/dart-async/Stream-class.html#instance-methods) exist on RxDart's Observables as well.
- All Observables can be passed to any API that expects a Dart Stream as an input.

### Instantiation

Generally speaking, creating a new Observable is either done by wrapping a Dart Stream using the top-level constructor `new Observable()`, or by calling a factory method on the Observable class.
But to better support Dart's strong mode, `combineLatest` and `zip` have been pulled apart into fixed-length constructors. 
These methods are supplied as static methods, since Dart's factory methods don't support generic types.

###### Usage
```dart
var myObservable = new Observable(myStream);
```

##### Available Factory Methods
- amb
- concat
- defer
- error
- just
- merge
- never
- periodic
- timer

###### Usage
```dart
var myObservable = new Observable.merge([myFirstStream, mySecondStream]);
```

##### Available Static Methods
- combineLatest (combineLatest2, combineLatest3, combineLatest4, ..., combineLatest9)
- range
- tween
- zip (zip2, zip3, zip4, ..., zip9)

###### Usage
```dart
var myObservable = Observable.combineLatest3(
    myFirstStream, 
    mySecondStream, 
    myThirdStream, 
    (firstData, secondData, thirdData) => print("$firstData $secondData $thirdData"));
```

### Transformations
    
##### Available Methods

- scan  
- skipUntil
- startWith  
- startWithMany  
- takeUntil  
- timeInterval  
- timestamp
- throttle
- windowWithCount
- withLatestFrom
- zipWith

###### Usage
```Dart
var myObservable = new Observable(myStream)
    .bufferWithCount(5)
    .distinct();
```
