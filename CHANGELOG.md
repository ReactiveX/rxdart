## 0.25.0-beta3
  * Bugfix: `switchMap` doesn't close after the last inner Stream closes.
  * Docs: updated URL for "Single-Subscription vs. Broadcast Streams" doc (thanks [Aman Gupta](https://github.com/Aman9026)).
  * Add `FromCallableStream`/`Rx.fromCallable`: allows you to create a `Stream` from a callable function.
  * Override `BehaviorSubject`'s built-in operators to correct replaying the latest value of `BehaviorSubject`.
  * Bugfix: Source `StreamSubscription` doesn't cancel when cancelling `refCount`, `zip`, `merge`, `concat` StreamSubscription.
  * Forward done event of upstream to `ConnectableStream`.

## 0.25.0-beta2
  * Internal refactoring Stream Transformers.
  * Fixed `RetryStream` example documentation.
  * Error thrown from `DeferStream` factory will now be caught and converted to `Stream.error`.
  * `doOnError` now have strong type signature: `Stream<T> doOnError(void Function(Object, StackTrace) onError)`.
  * Updated `ForkJoinStream`:
    * When any Stream emits an error, listening still continues unless `cancelOnError: true` on the downstream.
    * Pause and resume Streams properly.
  * Added `UsingStream`.
  * Updated `TimerStream`: Pause and resume Timer when pausing and resuming StreamSubscription.

## 0.25.0-beta
  * stream transformations on a ValueStream will also return a ValueStream, instead of 
    a standard broadcast Stream
  * throttle can now be both leading and trailing  
  * better handling of empty Lists when using operators that accept a List as input
  * error & hasError added to BehaviorSubject
  * various docs updates
  * note that this is a beta release, mainly because the behavior of transform has been adjusted (see first bullet)
    if all goes well, we'll release a proper 0.25.0 release soon

## 0.24.1

  * Adds pauseAll, resumeAll, ... to CompositeSubscription
  * Additionally, fixes some issues introduced with 0.24.0-dev.1

## 0.24.0-dev.1
  * Breaking: as of this release, we've refactored the way Stream transformers are set up.
  Previous releases had some incorrect behavior when using certain operators, for example:
    - startWith (startWithMany, startWithError)
    would incorrectly replay the starting event(s) when using a
    broadcast Stream at subscription time.
    - doOnX was not always producing the expected results:
      * doOnData did not output correct sequences on streams that were transformed 
      multiple times in sequence.
      * doOnCancel now acts in the same manner onCancel works on 
      regular subscriptions, i.e. it will now be called when all
      active subscriptions on a Stream are cancelled.
      * doOnListen will now call the first time the Stream is
      subscribed to, and will only call again after all subscribers
      have cancelled, before a new subscription starts.
  
      To properly fix this up, a new way of transforming Streams was introduced.    
      Operators as of now use Stream.eventTransformed and we've refactored all
      operators to implement Sink instead.
  * Adds takeWileInclusive operator (thanks to [@hoc081098](https://github.com/hoc081098))
  
  We encourage everyone to give the dev release(s) a spin and report back if
  anything breaks. If needed, a guide will be written to help migrate from
  the old behavior to the new behavior in certain common use cases.
  
  Keep in mind that we tend to stick as close as we can to how normal
  Dart Streams work!

## 0.22.3
  * Bugfix: whereType failing in Flutter production builds only

## 0.22.2
  * Bugfix: When using a seeded `BehaviorSubject` and adding an `Error`,
    upon listening, the `BehaviorSubject` emits `null` instead of the last `Error`.
  * Bugfix: calling cancel after a `switchMap` can cause a `NoSuchMethodError`.
  * Updated Flutter example to match the latest Flutter release
  * `Observable.withLatestFrom` is now expanded to accept 2 or more `Stream`s
    thanks to Petrus Nguyễn Thái Học (@hoc081098)!
  * Deprecates `ofType` in favor of `whereType`, drop `TypeToken`.

## 0.22.1
  Fixes following issues:
  * Erroneous behavior with scan and `BehaviorSubject`.
  * Bug where `flatMap` would cancel inner subscriptions in `pause`/`resume`.
  * Updates to make the current "pedantic" analyzer happy.

## 0.22.0
  This version includes refactoring for the backpressure operators:
  * Breaking Change: `debounce` is now split into `debounce` and `debounceTime`.
  * Breaking Change: `sample` is now split into `sample` and `sampleTime`.
  * Breaking Change: `throttle` is now split into `throttle` and `throttleTime`.

## 0.21.0
  * Breaking Change: `BehaviorSubject` now has a separate factory constructor `seeded()`
  This allows you to seed this Subject with a `null` value.
  * Breaking Change: `BehaviorSubject` will now emit an `Error`, if the last event was also an `Error`.
  Before, when an `Error` occurred before a `listen`, the subscriber would not be notified of that `Error`.
  To refactor, simply change all occurences of `BehaviorSubject(seedValue: value)` to `BehaviorSubject.seeded(value)`
  * Added the `groupBy` operator
  * Bugix: `doOnCancel`: will now await the cancel result, if it is a `Future`.
  * Removed: `bufferWithCount`, `windowWithCount`, `tween`
  Please use `bufferCount` and `windowCount`, `tween` is removed, because it never was an official Rx spec.
  * Updated Flutter example to work with the latest Flutter stable.

## 0.20.0
  * Breaking Change: bufferCount had buggy behavior when using `startBufferEvery` (was `skip` previously)
  If you were relying on bufferCount with `skip` greater than 1 before, then you may have noticed 
  erroneous behavior.
  * Breaking Change: `repeat` is no longer an operator which simply repeats the last emitted event n-times,
  instead this is now an Observable factory method which takes a StreamFactory and a count parameter.
  This will cause each repeat cycle to create a fresh Observable sequence.
  * `mapTo` is a new operator, which works just like `map`, but instead of taking a mapper Function, it takes
  a single value where each event is mapped to.
  * Bugfix: switchIfEmpty now correctly calls onDone
  * combineLatest and zip can now take any amount of Streams:
    * combineLatest2-9 & zip2-9 functionality unchanged, but now use a new path for construction.
    * adds combineLatest and zipLatest which allows you to pass through an Iterable<Stream<T>> and a combiner that takes a List<T> when any source emits a change.
    * adds combineLatestList / zipList which allows you to take in an Iterable<Stream<T>> and emit a Observable<List<T>> with the values. Just a convenience factory if all you want is the list!
    * Constructors are provided by the Stream implementation directly
  * Bugfix: Subjects that are transformed will now correctly return a new Observable where isBroadcast is true (was false before)  
  * Remove deprecated operators which were replaced long ago: `bufferWithCount`, `windowWithCount`, `amb`, `flatMapLatest`

## 0.19.0

  * Breaking Change: Subjects `onCancel` function now returns `void` instead of `Future` to properly comply with the `StreamController` signature.
  * Bugfix: FlatMap operator properly calls onDone for all cases
  * Connectable Observable: An observable that can be listened to multiple times, and does not begin emitting values until the `connect` method is called
  * ValueObservable: A new interface that allows you to get the latest value emitted by an Observable.
    * Implemented by BehaviorSubject
    * Convert normal observables into ValueObservables via `publishValue` or `shareValue`
  * ReplayObservable: A new interface that allows you to get the values emitted by an Observable.
      * Implemented by ReplaySubject
      * Convert normal observables into ReplayObservables via `publishReplay` or `shareReplay`  

## 0.18.1

* Add `retryWhen` operator. Thanks to Razvan Lung (@long1eu)! This can be used for custom retry logic.

## 0.18.0

* Breaking Change: remove `retype` method, deprecated as part of Dart 2.
* Add `flatMapIterable`

## 0.17.0

* Breaking Change: `stream` property on Observable is now private.
  * Avoids API confusion
  * Simplifies Subject implementation
  * Require folks who are overriding the `stream` property to use a `super` constructor instead 
* Adds proper onPause and onResume handling for `amb`/`race`, `combineLatest`, `concat`, `concat_eager`, `merge`  and `zip`
* Add `switchLatest` operator
* Add errors and stacktraces to RetryError class
* Add `onErrorResume` and `onErrorRetryWith` operators. These allow folks to return a specific stream or value depending on the error that occurred.
